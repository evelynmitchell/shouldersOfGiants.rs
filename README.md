I have no idea what I'm doing , but llm.c in rust

## Installing Rust

Following the instructions at [Rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust.

## llm.c overview

This repository includes a Makefile to build the C code in llm.c, two python programs containing the test and train data generation which I will also use, and two C programs to  test and train.

I will be converting the C code in llm.c to Rust code in llm.rs.

I will also be converting the test and train c programs.

There is no license in the original repository, so I will need to rewrite the python code.

I have some knowledge of C and CUDA, and a tiny bit of Rust, so I expect this to be a challenge.
